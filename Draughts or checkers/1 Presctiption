This document describes the details of this work

Me and my daughter Dasha want to start making a new game.
It would be our first game that we work for to do it.

But we would be happy if it will came to real life.

What we want?
- We want to make the simplest game - checkers  as they call it in US or draughts as they call it in UK.

Draughts (British English) or checkers[2] (American English) is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. Draughts developed from alquerque.[3] The name derives from the verb to draw or to move.[4]
